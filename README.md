## Dark Mode Toggle

The dark mode toggle is one of the key features of our landing page. Users can easily switch between light and dark themes by clicking on the toggle button. This functionality provides a delightful user experience and caters to users who prefer dark-themed interfaces.

## Local Storage Integration

We've integrated local storage functionality into the project to remember users' dark mode preferences across sessions. When a user toggles dark mode on or off, the setting is saved in the browser's local storage. So, the next time the user visits the landing page, it will automatically load in their preferred mode.
